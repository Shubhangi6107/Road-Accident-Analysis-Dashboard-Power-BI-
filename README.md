## Project Overview
This project navigate through crucial insights about road safety.Explore data on current casualities categorized by road type, casualities by day and dark, casuaities in urban and rural areas, and road surface conditions. Notably, urban roads claim 60% of casualties, with rural roads contributing 30%. 

## Data Sources
The data journey unfolds in the "road accident data" Excel file. It contains information revealing accident details like date, day of the week, junction control, accident severity, and more.

## Tools
In this data exploration adventure, my tools of choice were:

- **Excel:** Pivotal role for data cleaning and initial processing, making sure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- **Power BI:** The creative force behind dashboard creation, visualization, and report generation. I used KPIs, bar charts, and column charts to give life to the data.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
The path to meaningful insights involved:

1. **Data Loading and Inspection:** A crucial first step to understand the landscape.
2. **Handling Missing Values:** Ensuring our dataset is robust and reliable.
3. **Data Cleaning and Formatting:** Polishing the data to make it visually appealing.

## Project Learning
Here's what I learned along the project:

- **Urban Road Realities:** Discovering the stark impact of accidents on urban roads, prompting a focus on safety measures.
- **Dark Hour Dilemma:** Understanding the challenges during dark hours, leading to a call for enhanced safety protocols.
- **Rural Road Insights:** Noticing the significant contribution of rural roads, emphasizing the need for better infrastructure.
- **Lighting Conditions Awareness:** Realizing the importance of evaluating and improving lighting conditions for overall road safety.

## Recommendations
Based on these insights, here are some recommendations for our road safety journey:

1. **Urban Road Safety Measures:** Implement targeted safety measures on urban roads to address the higher casualty rate.
2. **Dark Hours Vigilance:** Enhance road safety protocols during dark hours to mitigate accidents and casualties.
3. **Rural Infrastructure Investment:** Allocate resources for improved road infrastructure in rural areas to reduce accident occurrences.
4. **Lighting Conditions Improvement:** Evaluate and improve lighting conditions on roads to enhance overall safety.
